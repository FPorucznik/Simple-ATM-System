All of users account data is stored in a database made with a code-first approach (the PINs are hashed with salts). The users can see their account balance, deposit money, withdraw money and show account details.

Note: The database is seeded with 2 default accounts used to test the application. (e.g account number: 123456789  PIN: 1234)
